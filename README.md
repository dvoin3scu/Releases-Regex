# Releases-Regex Repository

> [!NOTE]
> **This is a personal fork of [Vidhin05](https://github.com/Vidhin05)'s [Releases-Regex](https://github.com/Vidhin05/Releases-Regex).** All credit for the regex patterns, expression design, and scoring logic goes to him. I created this fork solely to maintain a centralized, fully importable version of his templates, with minor adjustments tailored to my personal requirements. Please visit and support the original repository for upstream updates.

Regular Expressions and ranked stream expressions (AIOStreams) for automatically **sorting and scoring** anime, movies, and TV show releases. Patterns are sourced from [TRaSH Guides](https://trash-guides.info) to score releases based on source quality (Remux, Bluray, WEB), release groups (both high-quality and low-quality), audio/visual tags (HDR, Atmos, DTS), and other quality indicators.

## 🚀 AIOStreams - Usage Instructions

This template **auto-syncs** updates to regex patterns and ranked stream expressions. Re-apply the template from About → Template Wizard only when the template itself (e.g. options or variants) changes.

### Stream Expression Score-based Sorting

#### **Installation**

1. On the AIOStreams configure page, `About -> Get Started -> Use a Template -> Vidhin's Regexes -> Load Template`
2. Choose a variant (**English**, **German**, or **Legacy English**).

Optionally import the template with the URL `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dvoin3scu/Releases-Regex/main/all-templates.json` if it does not show up.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Sort & formatter**
>
> - **Requires Stream Expression Score in sort** (not Regex). Add **Stream Expression Score** to your sort order.
> - If using a custom formatter, add `{stream.seScore}` and `{stream.rseMatched}`. **Do not use `regexMatched`**.
>
> This repo has two layers: (1) **regex patterns** (regexes.json) that match release titles, and (2) **ranked stream expressions** (expressions.json) that use those regexes as filters and assign RSE names with scores. Most RSEs are regex-based, but the expressions apply query-type checks, negations, and merges before output.
>
> `regexMatched` returns only the first pattern it matches. For a Kitsune anime release it will show Web T1 instead of Web T3 — incorrect tagging. Use `rseMatched` to see what actually impacted the score.

| --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `{stream.rseMatched}`                                                 | **Recommended.** Show all matched expressions — tier, bonuses (Dual Audio, Uncensored), penalties, etc. Full picture of what impacts the score. |
| `{stream.rseMatched::first}`                                          | First matched element only.                                                                                                                     |
| `{stream.rseMatched::first::~ T["{stream.rseMatched::first}"\|\|""]}` | **Tier only** (Remux T1, Web T1, etc.) — shows first element when it contains ` T`; hides bonus tags.                                           |
| `{stream.rseMatched::string::~Value["if contains"\|\|""]}`            | Treat array as joined string; check if it contains `Value` (substring).                                                                         |

> [!NOTE]
> I recommend using a SEL to smartly limit and filter streams instead of using exclude regexes. You can use [Tamtaro's](https://github.com/Tam-Taro/SEL-Filtering-and-Sorting#-how-to-import).

### Customizing Scores

The template includes several ranked stream expressions whose effect can be customized by overriding their scores in synced ranked expressions. (Filters -> Stream Expressions -> Ranked Stream Expressions -> Synced URLs -> Expand URL -> Override score using 📝 or Disable/Enable using the checkbox)

#### **Anime Dual Audio**

If you prefer Dual Audio releases, you can adjust the score based on your preference:

- **Within same tier**: Score of `10` (prefers dual audio over single audio in the same quality tier)
- **One tier above**: Score of `101` (prefers dual audio from a lower tier over single audio from a higher tier)
- **Over any tier**: Score of `2000` (always prefers dual audio regardless of quality tier)
- You may also want to disable `Dubs Only` or give it a positive score same as or lower than `Anime Dual Audio`'s if you only watch dubs.

#### **Uncensored**

If you prefer Uncensored anime releases, you can adjust the score similarly:

- **Within same tier**: Score of `10` (prefers uncensored within the same quality tier)
- **One tier above**: Score of `101` (prefers uncensored from a lower tier over censored from a higher tier)

Using these scoring options, you'll still benefit from the tier system when better release groups provide Dual Audio or Uncensored releases.

#### **Other Customizable Expressions**

- **DV w/o HDR fallback** (disabled by default): Enable DV w/o HDR fallback ranked SEL if not all your devices support DV. This also applies to DV releases without HDR10 fallback (Profile 5).
- **10bit** (disabled by default): Enable to filter out 10-bit encodes if your devices (FireStick, etc.) don't support them.
- **Anime Dual Audio** (disabled by default): Adjust score based on your preference (see above for scoring options).
- **Uncensored**: Adjust score based on your preference (see above for scoring options).
- **Dubs Only**: Disable to keep anime dub-only streams.
- **Bad Dual Groups**: Disable to keep dual audio groups with non-English as primary language.
- **x265**: Disable to keep x265 HD encodes without HDR/DV.
- **3D**: Disable to keep 3D releases if you want them.
- **Obfuscated**: Disable to keep obfuscated releases (Enabled by default, but feel free to adjust score as needed.).
- **Retags**: Disable to keep retagged releases (Enabled by default, but feel free to adjust score as needed.).
